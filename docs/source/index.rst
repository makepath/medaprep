=====================================
Overview
########

Porcupine is a data preparation and feature engineering toolkit for geospatial applications. 

Porcupine comes from unit-porcupine, a representation of a common problem in high-dimensional datasets. As the dimensionality of the data increases, samples tend to exist at the "tips of the quills of a porcupine" in hyperspace. This library focuses on providing a simple workflow for dealing with large high-dimensional datasets.
